<p>I received the B.Eng. degree in Automation from <a href="https://www.bit.edu.cn/">Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</a>, Beijing, China, in 2021. I once studied Electrical & Computer Engineering in <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington (UW)</a>, Seattle, USA, in 2019. I am currently pursing the Ph.D. degree with the <a href="https://csicdgz.bit.edu.cn/">National Key Lab of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems</a>, BIT, Beijing, China. My current research interests include operations research and machine learning for solving complex real-world systems under uncertainty.</p>

<p>I have authored 4 high-quality <a href="https://levi-zhang-11.github.io/research.html">Research Papers</a> in the field of operations research, optimization, machine learning, and their applications in facility location, sensor networks management, routing problems. I have applied or been issued 5 C.N. Patents. I participate in research projects supported by National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC), National Key Research and Development Program of China, etc.</p>

<p>I serve as the Reviewers for several high-quality journals and international conferences. I also serve as the Editor-in-Chief of Transportation & Logistics Section in one of the largest Operations Research communities in China. We are currently having more than 800,000 subscribers. Besides, I was the concertmaster of <a href="https://levi-zhang-11.github.io/miscellaneous.html">BIT Student Symphony Orchestra</a> founded in 2000. I served as the head of this wonderful orchestra in 2020. Tutti !</p>
